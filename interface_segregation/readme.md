# Interface segregation principle
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interface they don't use.
- If there is any method that is not related to the interface, the class dependent on the interface has to implement 
it unnecessarily.
- This principle talks about software developrs writing their interface well.
- For instance, it reminds the developers/architects to developer methods that relate to the functionality.
- If there is any method that is not related to the interface, the class dependent on the interface has to implement 
it unnecessarily.
