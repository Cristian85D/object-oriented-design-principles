# The substitution principle
- Object should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Derived class must be able to completely substitute the base classes.
- This principle is pretty straightforward(sencillo) in the sense(dice) that it says when application developers 
write derived classes, they should extend the base class. 
- It also suggests that the derived class should as close(cerca) to the base class as 
possible so much so that the derived class itself should replace the base class without any code changes.
